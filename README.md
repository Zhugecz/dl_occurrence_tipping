# Deep learning for the occurrence of tipping points

This is the code repository to accompnay the article:

***Deep learning for the occurrence of tipping points.*** *Chengzuo Zhuge, Jiawei Li, Wei Chen.*

# Requirements

Python 3.7 is required. To install python package dependencies, use the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

within a new virtual environment.

The bifurcation continuation software AUTO-07P is required. Installation instructions are provided at http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~gabriel/auto07/auto.html


# Directories
**./dl_model:** Code to train the deep learning algorithm. And trained deep learning models used in manuscript.

**./dl_null_model:** Code to train the null model. And trained null models used in manuscript.

**./dl_combined_model:** Code to train the combined model. And trained combined models used in manuscript.

**./gen_train_set:** Code to generate training data for the deep learning algorithm.

**./model_test:** Code to simulate, perform regular and irregular sampling, and compute residual time series for the test models, to compute indicators of competing algorithms in the regularly-sampled situation, and to test trained deep learning models on simulated model test time series. These include the May's harvesting model, three-species food chain model, consumerâˆ’resource model, global energy balance model, middle Pleistocene transition model, Amazon rainforest dieback model, sleep-wake hysteresis loop model and Sprott B hysteresis bursting model. The model test time series data after sampling and computing residual we used in manuscript is also in this directory.

**./empirical_test:** Code to perform irregular sampling and compute residual time series for the empirical datasets, and to test trained deep learning models on empirical test time series. These include the cyanobacteria microcosm experiment, the thermoacoustic experiment and the metallic elements in sediment cores. The original empirical datasets and the empirical test time series data after sampling and computing residual we used in manuscript are also in this directory.

**./results:** Experimental results of the trained deep learning models on the model time series data and the empirical test time series data.

**./draw_fig:** Code to generate figures used in manuscript.

**./figure:** Figures used in manuscript.
